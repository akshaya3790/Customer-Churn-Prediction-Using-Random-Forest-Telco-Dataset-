# Customer-Churn-Prediction-Using-Random-Forest-Telco-Dataset-

This project aims to predict customer churn using the Telco Customer Churn dataset from IBM. The objective is to identify patterns that influence whether a customer will leave the company, using a machine learning model built with a Random Forest classifier.

Dataset
The dataset used is the Telco Customer Churn dataset (`WA_Fn-UseC_-Telco-Customer-Churn.csv`) which includes information on:
- Customer demographics
- Services signed up for
- Account information
- Churn status

Problem Statement
Customer churn is a major issue in telecom industries. The goal is to use predictive modeling to:
- Identify customers likely to churn
- Understand the key factors driving churn
- Assist business teams in designing retention strategies

Tools and Libraries Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy for data manipulation
- Matplotlib, Seaborn for data visualization
- Scikit-learn for machine learning
